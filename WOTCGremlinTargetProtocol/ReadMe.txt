This mod grants an upgraded version of Combat Protocol to any [b]Specialist[/b] that has [b]Combat Protocol[/b] AND [b]Scanning Protocol[/b].

The new Target Protocol functions the same way as Combat Protocol but also adds a holo-target style affect that helps boost squadmates chance to crit.

The ability costs 1 action point to use and is turn-ending, just like Combat Protocol. However, it has a 3 turn cooldown instead of charges.
It requires the Specialist to have Line of Sight to the unit but can be used at squadsight ranges, just like regular Combat Protocol.
Also like regular Combat Protocol it will do double damage to robotics, but will also do double damage to things that are 'like' robotics (such as codex or spectre).
Target Protocol will also deny a codex from splitting/teleporting when used against one.

The crit chance bonus scales with GREMLIN tier and lasts for 2 turns.
[list][*]Conventional Tier/MkI: +15[*]Magnetic Tier/MkII: +17[*]Beam Tier/MkIII: +20[/list]

The joy of Target Protocol is that it allows you to apply a crit chance bonus to units that cannot normally be flanked, such as MEC's and Sectopods.

Includes a custom coloured holo-target visual effect.

Most of these effects and the scaling level can be adjusted in the config file.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
Occasionally the scanning effect doesn't visualize, sometimes the GREMLIN flies way off target.
I've seen this happen with other GREMLIN abilities too, I do not how to correct it.

There may be some issues with using classes that are not the standard Specialist as the default setup requires a soldier to have both Combat Protocol and Scanning Protocol.
Please feel free to experiment with the config settings until you get something that 'works' for your class setup

As always I'm open for bug reports in the comments below

[h1]Credits and Thanks[/h1]
The idea was inspired by NavyFEELTeamSix on the XCOM2 Modders discord.
Code assistance was given by CX Iridar and Robojumper from the modders discord for the scaling by tier effect.
Massive shout outs to Mr.Nice and Musashi for help getting the visualization and perk package to 'work' correctly.

~ Enjoy :)
